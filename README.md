# A Demonstration of WebDNA in a Docker Container!

Documentation will continuously be added in future updates. Right now the goal is to create a very basic docker container with WebDNA and demonstrate its capabilities. This project is **NOT** meant for production use and is just the bare minimum as a proof of concept. Best practices are not always followed in this project- utilize in production at your own risk!

[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) should be installed in order to run and build the containers. 

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended for working with containers (due to the many extensions and integrations it has) but is not required. The use of powershell/terminal is required though.

## Why would I want to run WebDNA in a container?
There are a lot of reason why you might want to run WebDNA in a container, [containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) are a powerful technology for developing, managing, and running web applications.

The biggest reason though would be having a highly portable, cross platform, easily set up environment for WebDNA development. Build your own or pull a public image from the docker repository, spin it up in docker desktop and start coding in WebDNA on localhost!
